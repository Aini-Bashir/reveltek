My current role in assisting the process of taking RevelTek from a small startup to an enterprise level business will be to do research and planning to help get us to the next phase. I will use my knowledge of the industry to do research into the current market and understand the needs of customers. I will also research potential strategic partnerships to help RevelTek conduct analysis to define where we are in the market. I will also use my skills in research and analysis to assess customer feedback and develop an assessment of what the customer needs are. Finally, I will research advanced AI, Tech Consulting, and Innovation solutions that can help RevelTek reach the enterprise level.
