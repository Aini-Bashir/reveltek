To change the drop-down menu of a website hosted on GitHub, you will need to perform the following steps:

Navigate to the repository for the website on GitHub.

Find the file that contains the HTML code for the drop-down menu. This is usually a file with a .html or .htm extension.

Click on the file to open it in the browser.

Use the browser's "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" feature to locate the code for the drop-down menu. This will typically be an HTML <select> element with a series of <option> elements nested inside it.

Edit the HTML code for the drop-down menu as desired. This could involve adding or removing <option> elements, or modifying the text or values of the existing <option> elements.

Once you have made your changes, save the file and commit the changes to the repository.

Push the updated repository to the GitHub server.

Refresh the webpage in your browser to see the changes you have made to the drop-down menu.

It's worth noting that making changes to a website hosted on GitHub will require some familiarity with HTML and Git, as well as an understanding of how to use the GitHub web interface. If you are not familiar with these technologies, you may want to seek guidance from someone with more experience or consider learning the necessary skills before attempting to make changes to the website.
