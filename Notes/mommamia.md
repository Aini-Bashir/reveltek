## Momma Mia's Quest to Culinary Artistry

### Space
Mia has always dreamed of making cupcakes and cute wedding treats.  She has lots of friends who are getting married and the grannies around her all know how to cook the best foods you could ever imagine.
Mia wants to be known as Momma Mia and open a bakery that caters events, specifically weddings.  There is already a business down the street called Willy's Weddings & Willy's will be Momma Mia's main competition. 
We will make sure to have more fresh ingredients and only mothers working in our kitchen for women empowerment.
Mia doesn't have very much money, but her husband does and so do his friends.
Mia cannot read and only speaks Urdu.

### Track
We currently only have an idea of this concept.  We need to make a business plan and organize our kitchen and also we need to get magical recipes that customers will love.
Currently, we should focus on the business plan.

### Assist
Momma Mia will bake goodies for the 3 grannies who will in turn start writing the business plan.  They will write 2 pages per day until the 30 page business plan is complete.  They hope at this rate, they can have the entire business plan finished in 2 weeks time.

### Reach
Once the business plan is complete, they can present it to Momma Mia's wealthy husband. If he likes it and approves of it, he will give them plenty of startup money to go ahead and remodel the kitchen and to start testing out on some treats.  The only reach we are expecting at this stage is to give the business plan to some of our family & friends in the hopes they will invest in Momma Mia's dream.
