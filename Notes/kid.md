## Sadena's STAR

### Space
Sadena is a 3 year old living with her mommy and her daddy.  She also lives with her aunt, her 2 uncles, and their cat, Charlie. Sadena has lived in this house for just 1 year. She is not from this area. She has a market close to her. She has music playing next door. And Charlie always sits on her lap.  Mommy and auntie are always in the kitchen. Daddy is always on the computer.

### Track
Sadena wants to be the best girl ever. She wants to grow up and be an astronaut.  So, she studies numbers and astronomy everyday. Currently, she is studying the distance from earth to the moon. To do so, she needs to cut out a paper Earth & a paper moon that are the right size.  She needs to color them & put them on a map the right distance away. Mommy is going to help if she can get time away from the kitchen. Sadena is having trouble using the scissors and will wait for Mommy to come help.

### Assist
Sadena will practice practice practice using scissors.  Once she masters the scissors, her project can be on its way!  She will practice with the scissor for another week before she tries to make her moon again.  The last moon ended up looking like a piece of pizza, so she needs to keep trying until it looks nice & round.

### Reach
Once the moon and earth are cut out, others will see the first steps of Sadena on her path to becoming an Astronaut.  Maybe if daddy sees the cut outs, he will buy the glue that she needs to put it on the map board.  For now, the little astronaut will at least have some fun cut outs to play with and can involve the other family members in her activities.
